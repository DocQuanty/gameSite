              For a long time, we worked as a one- and two-person team, but we
              consider Dorfer Gamesâ€™ official birthday to be Spring 2020. That's
              when we started to go full steam ahead on creating hyper-casual
              games, working with the market's best publishers, making lots of
              games, and learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              We are now actively expanding. That's why we're recruiting
              talented professionals from around the world to create hit games.
